essentially we are going to be tracking the sun throughout any given point in the day 
so that people know how to most efficiently place their solar items ( solar panels, solar chargers, etc.)

using geocoder we will gain access to the users exact location via house address using google maps. This then allows 
us to correlate their address with the weather API for the most optimal placement of their solar device. if their solar device is
stagnant, it will tell them how much energy they will be getting that day.

by them giving us the the degree north of their solar device, the wattage, as well as the angle of their device we will be able
to let them know how much solar energy they will produce with their device.
